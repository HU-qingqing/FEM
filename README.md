This code use the methode of finite element to solve a second-order partial differential equation with different boundary condition (Neumann boundary condition, Drichelet boundary condition and periodic boundary condition). <br> 


For the exacte equation, please read the document named [description_of_problem.pdf](https://github.com/HU-qingqing/FEM/blob/main/description_of_problem.pdf).
